        <h3>R.W2 - Ulises Carrión</h3>
        <a href="#closer">X</a>
        <h6>From 'Selections From Second Thoughts'. In the reading for week 2, Ulysses Carrion analyzes the dynamic between writers, writing, and books across history. He differentiates between ‘the old art’ of writing and the ‘new art’, identifying the shift from the intentional, utilitarian communication of novels and old writing to the self-aware space-time experience that is this new art of writing and bookmaking. Carrion calls this shift, of modern books of poetry reinventing their use of space and time, “an enormous event of literally incalculable consequences” (12). This reading was highly abstract and seemingly fragmented but contained insightful ideas about the mechanisms of the new art of language and bookmaking.

        <a href="#closer">X</a>
        <h6>From 'Essay 5' and 'Essay 10'. These two authors write separate essays that each discuss the importance of the internet as an extension of the powers of the psyche. Schwulst first talks about website-building as pure self expression due to the creative nature of even the structure of information, writing, “"website creators become both author and architect simultaneously". The guiding idea of Edouard U’s essay is that “nothing exists in isolation”, and that things such as our interpretation of textual information are the result of complex neural networks.</h6>

        <h3>R.W4 - Ludovico & Cramer</h3>
        <a href="#closer">X</a>
        <h6>From 'Selections From Publishing From Post-Digital Print'. 
            Recently, no medium/message technology has changed more than the practice of publishing. As the printed page, which is ‘the medium and message itself’, goes digital, the realm of publishing from a consumer and a publisher’s standpoint changes. It becomes streamlined and accessible, as well as transforming into a new method of activism. The authors inspired me to think about what ‘hybrid’ future publishing will look, feel, act like. I am excited but also partially apprehensive about the possibility for publishing to eventually look like a completely new thing. Will the tradition and habits of older modes of publication be completely replaced, or will they stick around and take new forms?

        <h3> R.W6 - David Reinfurt</h3>
        <a href="#closer">X</a>
        <h6>From 'A New Program For Graphic Design'. This reading by David Reinfurt covers two elements of his ‘new program for graphic design’: gestalt theory and interface design. The former of which describes how ‘discrete elements produce coherent groups’ while the latter is part of the early progress by designers Muriel Cooper and Donis A Dondis. It was interesting to see some of the science of perception behind gestalt theory. The excerpts about Wertheimer’s efforts on the biology of this core design element makes me wonder about other principles or core design elements whose bases can be explained by human biology. Finally, one quote that stood out to me can be found on page 235. It reads, “In interface design, the most consequential work doesn’t have a template”. </h6>

        <h3>R.W8 - Coklyat & Finnegan</h3>
        <a href="#closer">X</a>
        <h6> From 'Alt Text As Poetry'. 
            The stated goal of this text was to raise the reader’s awareness to and creativity with alt text. We are urged to focus on the impaired/limited user in our use of alt-text when posting/publishing. In addition, this ‘workbook’ also approaches the power of alt-text as a robust mode communication, in a poetic and/or translating way.

        <h3>R.W11 - Ramsey Nasser</h3>
        <a href="#closer">X</a>
        <h6>Using the One Laptop Per Child initiative as an example, Nasser discusses the issues with computer languages that are not suitable for interacting with non-Latin alphabet text. Because of differences with page-direction and glyph identification, these languages and their speakers are marginalized. He writes that because programs are the result of generations of effort in each developer’s native culture, present-day languages like Python and Html are set in stone as English-centric. In order to solve this problem, developers across the world could begin a lingua franca, a shared language that crosses the divides between native tongues (p. 38). Nasser raises important points about the biases that limit the use of computers as a [necessary] tool for participation in global development.</h6>

            Discover and apply the basics of HTML and CSS languages as layout and styling tools Utilize core design principles (such as framing, closed vs. open composition, overlap & continuity, directional movement, reduction, and abstraction) to creatively interpret a collective artwork (3-dimensional) as personal representation (2-dimensional).

        Highlights: Establish a consistent visual style to deliver uniform messaging and theming. What is the flow of information (steady or dynamic)? Navigation system between pages? Demonstrate intentional strategies to guide a viewer, using principles of sequence. A page must utilize a grid: flexbox, floats, or tables. Organize your files and directories by instituting and delivering an effective, logical schema. >

Your “clock” doesn’t need to resemble a traditional clock, and may instead employ other functions that are triggered by these events.

            <p> - </p>
    

            Highlights: Ideate and sketch out a minimum of 3 concepts that investigate the clock’s relationship to form and function. You will choose one of your sketches to prototype in p5.js. Discover the basics of JavaScript syntax (and p5.js naming conventions) in order to realize your creative concept within your abilities. You may need to make concessions or revisit your initial idea in order to better suit your developing skill sets. Be able to comfortably explain your concept, process, and code (line by line) in a critique setting.
